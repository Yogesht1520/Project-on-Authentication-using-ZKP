This project is a part of Academic curriculum under which we tried to create a authentication mechansim which unlike traditional mechanisms doesn't store usernames and passwords at the server side which makes the mechanism more secure and less susceptible to man in the middle attacks.

We have used python for the development of our authentication tool and implemented SHA-256 for the encyption algorithm.
For Frontend, as an example a basic HTML framework is used for demonstration of how the username and password are entered but not stored on servers.

The USP of the project is the addition of and extra Layer in the IP stack which could enhance the interoperaility of the mechanism over various devices and thus solve the most recurring from of Zero Knowledge Proofs, i.e., Interoperability across platforms.
